# pihole-dnsblinks
Code for blinking LEDs based on DNS requests made to a Pi-hole Raspberry Pi

Just hook some LEDs and resistors up to BCM pins 17, 27, and 22 (physical pins 11, 13, and 15. There is also a convenient ground at pin 9). One will blink for forwards, one for cached responses, and one for blocks.
